Dependencies:
- (EWW wacky widgets)[https://github.com/elkowar/eww]

Reason why it's not in use anymore:
- EWW's config language is based on a lisp dialect which makes it unintuitive to me
- More complex EWW widgets rely on custom written scripts/binaries, which actually means I need to write most of the backend part myself anyway
